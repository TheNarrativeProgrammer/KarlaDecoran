        <p>About me</p>
        <p>
            My name is Karla Decoran, I am a self-taught artist from Vancouver, BC.
            Everyday I see an opportunity to find beauty in the natural world.
            I aspire to help people envision their own perspective of beauty and express this with art.
            I am a prospective UX/UI designer, as it is my goal to create solutions and help others through design.
        </p>

        <p>
            I taught myself how to draw before I learned how to write my name. My childhood hobby evolved into a full time hobby as an adult,
            manifesting into art shows, a prolific social media platform, and art displays in public spaces. My first medium was pen and paper but now I am teaching myself to use
            digital programs such as Concepts, Figma, and Adobe Illustrator to diversify my art style. Professionally, I am a registered veterinary technician, I have been in the veterinary field for 14 years and currently work in emergency medicine.
            I am enrolled in the Digital Design program of Vancouver Film School, starting September 2025.
            Along with full time work, I am also a dedicated ultra-marathoner and complete an average of 3-4 marathons or ultra-marathons a year.
            <div></div>
            This website was designed by me, using HTML and CSS.
